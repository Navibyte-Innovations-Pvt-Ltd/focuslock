# focuslock — CLAUDE.md

## What this is
macOS CLI tool that temporarily unblocks distracting sites in `/etc/hosts`, then auto-reblocks after a user-chosen duration. Interactive: picks sites, picks duration, spawns background timer.

## File map
```
focuslock          main CLI binary — all logic lives here
install.sh         copies binary, seeds config, adds /etc/hosts entries
uninstall.sh       removes binary, removes /etc/hosts entries, removes config
```

## Critical logic — read before touching hosts code

**BLOCKED state** = active line in /etc/hosts:
```
127.0.0.1    instagram.com
```

**ALLOWED state** = commented out:
```
# 127.0.0.1    instagram.com
```

This is counterintuitive. "allow" = add `#`. "block" = remove `#`.

Commenting patterns (macOS BSD sed, NOT GNU):
```bash
# Allow (add # prefix to active block entries):
sed -i '' -E "/^127\.0\.0\.1[[:space:]]+(www\.)?${escaped}/s/^/# /" /etc/hosts

# Block (remove # prefix from commented entries):
sed -i '' -E "s/^#[[:space:]]*(127\.0\.0\.1[[:space:]]+(www\.)?${escaped})/\1/" /etc/hosts
```

Escape dots in domain for sed regex: `escaped="${domain//./\\.}"`

Always flush DNS after any /etc/hosts change:
```bash
dscacheutil -flushcache && killall -HUP mDNSResponder 2>/dev/null
```

## Config
- `~/.focuslock/sites` — one base domain per line, no `www.`, `#` = comment
- `/tmp/focuslock.pid` — PID of background reblock timer
- `/tmp/focuslock-allowed` — newline list of sites currently allowed (block reads this to know what to restore)

## Timer mechanism
`allow` spawns a nohup background process:
```bash
nohup bash -c "sleep $((MINUTES * 60)) && sudo '$SCRIPT_PATH' block" > /tmp/focuslock.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > /tmp/focuslock.pid
```
Survives terminal close. Running `allow` again kills old timer and starts fresh.

## Known gotchas

**Chrome DNS cache**: OS DNS flush (`dscacheutil`) doesn't clear Chrome's internal DNS cache. Chrome caches DNS ~1 min. Fix: `block` closes all Chrome tabs for blocked domains via AppleScript — forces fresh DNS lookup on next visit.

**AppleScript + root**: Running `osascript` as root fails with `-1743` (not authorized to send Apple events). Must run as logged-in user:
```bash
LOGGED_USER=$(stat -f "%Su" /dev/console)
sudo -u "$LOGGED_USER" osascript << 'APPLESCRIPT'
...
APPLESCRIPT
```

**bash 3.2**: macOS ships bash 3.2 (GPL license). No `declare -A` (associative arrays added in 4.0). No `mapfile`/`readarray`. Use while+read loops and case statements instead.

**BSD sed vs GNU sed**: macOS uses BSD sed. `sed -i ''` (empty string required). No `\|` alternation in basic regex — use `-E` for extended regex with `(a|b)` syntax.

**www. variants**: Every domain in config needs both `domain.com` and `www.domain.com` entries in /etc/hosts. `install.sh` and `add` command handle this. Sed patterns use `(www\.)?` to match both.

## Subcommand map
| Command | Needs root | What it does |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| `allow` | yes | prompts site + duration, comments out entries, starts timer |
| `block` | yes | uncomments entries from ALLOWED_FILE (or all), closes Chrome tabs |
| `add <domain>` | yes | appends to sites file, adds /etc/hosts entries |
| `remove <domain>` | yes | removes from sites file and /etc/hosts |
| `list` | no | reads sites file, checks current state in /etc/hosts |
| `status` | no | checks if PID in pidfile is alive |

Root elevation: script self-elevates via `exec sudo "$0" "$@"` at top based on subcommand.

## Development workflow

Test a sed pattern before applying to real hosts file:
```bash
echo "127.0.0.1	instagram.com" | sed -E '/^127\.0\.0\.1[[:space:]]+(www\.)?instagram/s/^/# /'
echo "# 127.0.0.1	instagram.com" | sed -E 's/^#[[:space:]]*(127\.0\.0\.1[[:space:]]+(www\.)?instagram)/\1/'
```

Check current hosts state:
```bash
grep -E "(linkedin|facebook|instagram|amazon|youtube)" /etc/hosts
```

Check timer:
```bash
focuslock status
cat /tmp/focuslock.pid
cat /tmp/focuslock-allowed
```

After editing `focuslock` locally, reinstall:
```bash
sudo cp focuslock /usr/local/bin/focuslock
```

## Do not
- Hardcode site list anywhere — always read from `~/.focuslock/sites`
- Use `declare -A` or `mapfile` — bash 3.2 incompatible
- Run `osascript` as root — use `sudo -u "$LOGGED_USER"`
- Use GNU sed syntax — macOS uses BSD sed
- Connect to any remote/production host — localhost only
- Remove the `# ` prefix check in block's sed — double-unblocking corrupts hosts file
